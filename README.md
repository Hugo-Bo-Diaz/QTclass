-Sergi Parra: Last time I saw him was on monday, we talked briefly about having to do this practice and that was it... 
due to his record I decided that it was better to work on my own until he decided to contact me, 
then we would've worked together. As of 21:00pm of the delivery date I have still to recieve a message from him.
